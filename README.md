### I believe

- We should limit software complexity to the minimum amount necessary to accomplish the purpose
- Sotware should imitate life more and be: decentralized, resilient, adaptable, interoperable, competitive and collaborative at the same time, space filling, efficient and redundant
- We should secure internet's future as a free medium for collaboration
